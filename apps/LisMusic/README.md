# LisMusic (远征队音乐) — Aether-UI port

A port of **LisMusic**, a NetEase-Cloud-Music-style desktop music player,
from its original **Qt 6 / QML + C++** implementation to the Aether-UI
toolkit.

## Credit

The original LisMusic is by **SLTwitness**
(<https://github.com/SLTwitness>, 2039935260@qq.com) — see the upstream
repository for the Qt/QML source, screenshots, and release binaries. All
of the design, the UI, the feature set, and the artwork are theirs; this
directory is a structural translation of that work onto a different
toolkit. The original carries no explicit licence.

The Chinese UI strings of the original have been translated to English
here (the sidebar sections, the player chrome, the settings labels, etc.).

## What this port is — and is not

The original is a full client: it plays audio (QtMultimedia), persists
history and local-library paths in **SQLite**, extracts cover art with the
**FFmpeg** CLI, and pulls songs from a third-party HTTP+JSON API on a
worker thread. Of those, **SQLite is real here** — `lis_store` is backed by
`contrib.sqlite`, faithful to the original's `history` schema and
persisted to `history.db` across runs. **Three subsystems still have no
Aether-UI peer** (audio playback, an image-decode-from-bytes path for
cover art, and a threaded-network story wired into the widget loop), so a
faithful, *working* clone is not achievable on this toolkit today.

What this port **does** deliver, faithfully, is the **UI and its
structure**:

- the same **decomposition** — one Aether module per original QML/C++
  concern (see the file map below);
- the real **three-region shell**: left sidebar (nav sections + "My
  Music"), right stack-paged content, bottom player bar;
- the **Config event-bus** — the original's `Config.qml` singleton
  (signals + shared state) rebuilt on Aether-UI's typed state + bindings,
  which is the same observer/event-bus pattern;
- the page-stack navigation, the search field, the login popup as a modal
  overlay, and the now-playing chrome (title / artist / transport /
  seek / volume).

The backend subsystems are isolated behind clearly-marked **seams**
(`lis_audio`, `lis_store`, `lis_cover`, `lis_net`) — each a small module
with the original's method signatures. `lis_store` is **real**
(contrib.sqlite; search history round-trips and persists). The other
three are honest stubs (e.g. `lis_audio.start_play()` logs and no-ops).
Wiring a real backend in later means implementing one seam module, not
rewriting the app — `lis_store` is the worked example of exactly that.
Every stub says so at its call site.

## File map (original → port)

| Original (QML/C++) | This port | Concern |
|---|---|---|
| `Config.qml` (singleton) | `lis_config.ae` | event bus + shared state |
| `LisMusic.qml`, `main.qml` | `lismusic.ae` | window + three-region shell |
| `LeftPage.qml` | `lis_leftpage.ae` | sidebar nav |
| `RightPage.qml`, `RightTopTitle.qml` | `lis_rightpage.ae` | top bar + page stack |
| `BottomSection.qml` | `lis_bottom.ae` | now-playing player bar |
| `Searchtop.qml`, `SearchData.qml` | `lis_search.ae` | search field + results |
| `Loginpop.qml`, `OtherLoginpop.qml` | `lis_login.ae` | login popup (framework only, as in the original) |
| `ButtonHover.qml`, `ChoseButton.qml`, `SelectBox.qml` | `lis_widgets.ae` | reusable UI bits |
| `musicplay.{h,cpp}` | `lis_audio.ae` | **seam**: playback (stub — no audio API) |
| `savehisty.{h,cpp}` | `lis_store.ae` | **seam**: SQLite persistence (**REAL** — contrib.sqlite) |
| `ffmpegsolve.{h,cpp}` | `lis_cover.ae` | **seam**: cover extraction (stub — no image decode) |
| `netmusic*.{h,cpp}`, `musicworker.{h,cpp}` | `lis_net.ae` | **seam**: HTTP/JSON API (stub — canned results) |

## Tests

A driver spec (`tests/LisMusic/spec_lismusic.ae`, ci Phase 7 / spec_matrix
row `lismusic`) drives the running app over the AetherUIDriver and proves
the real behaviours: the three-region shell renders, sidebar nav switches
the right-page tab stack, search populates the results each-list, and the
transport play/pause + result Play buttons are wired. 5/5.
