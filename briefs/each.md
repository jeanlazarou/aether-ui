# Brief: `each` — dynamic children (roadmap item 3)

**Status: READY FOR EXECUTION.** 2026-07-12. Self-contained hand-off —
everything needed is in this file or at the cited file:line anchors.
Written for an autonomous session; escalation triggers are explicit.

## Mission

Give containers dynamic children driven by a list: an `each` verb that
(re)builds a per-item widget subtree when the list changes, so apps stop
pre-allocating widget pools. Concretely:

1. `ui.each(parent) callback |item, i| { …build item widgets… }` + an
   update entry point that re-renders from a new list.
2. Whatever child-management backends still lack (insert-at; verified
   remove/clear coverage — see ground truth: more exists than the
   roadmap thought).
3. The proving consumer: **grand_perspective's breadcrumb pool of 8
   pre-made buttons becomes real dynamic crumbs** (the original wound).
4. Driver-first (house rule 1): an example + Aeocha spec asserting
   widgets appear/disappear in `/widgets` as the list changes; full
   ci.sh green.

## Ground truth (verified 2026-07-12 — start here; two roadmap claims are STALE)

- **Runtime creation + attach is SHIPPED CODE, not just a probe.**
  `examples/overlay_demo/overlay_demo.ae` builds its modal card
  imperatively INSIDE a button callback: `card = root_vstack(10)` then
  `_ = text(card, "…")`, `_ = btn(card, "Dismiss") callback {…}` — the
  handle-as-`_ctx` first-arg pattern attaches at runtime and displays
  (landed 526bd6a, spec-covered in ci Phase 5b). There is NO
  `builder_context()` function anywhere in the repo — the roadmap's
  sketch of one is pseudo-code; capturing the container's *handle*
  (every container verb returns it) IS the mechanism. Ergonomics item
  (c) from the roadmap is therefore mostly *verify + document*, not
  build.
- **remove_child / clear_children ALREADY EXIST** (the roadmap's
  "removal doesn't" is stale): exported from `ui/module.ae:48`, wrappers
  at ~1182, impls on ALL THREE backends —
  `backend/aether_ui_gtk4.c:2895` (`gtk_box_remove`, GTK_IS_BOX only),
  win32 (`DestroyWindow` + `stack_do_layout`), macOS
  (`removeArrangedSubview`, NSStackView only). BUT: zero consumers,
  zero test coverage — treat them as unproven until the spec exercises
  them. GTK4's is box-only (no grid/overlay support; fine for v1).
- **Insert-at does NOT exist** (append-only via
  `aether_ui_widget_add_child_ctx`). GTK4 has
  `gtk_box_insert_child_after` when needed.
- **Widget registry** (`backend/aether_ui_gtk4.c:63-88`): append-only
  handle table with a weak-ref finalizer that NULLs the slot on widget
  destruction (`on_widget_finalized`) — so removed widgets don't leave
  dangling handles; every `aether_ui_get_widget` consumer NULL-checks.
  Handles are never reused; fine.
- **Closure lifetime:** `btn(...)` boxes its closure (`box_closure`) and
  the C side retains it. Removing/destroying a button does NOT free its
  boxed closure — a small leak per removed button. Accept + document
  for v1 (crumbs churn a handful per navigation); don't build a
  closure-release protocol in this brief.
- **The wound (proving consumer):** gp's crumb pool —
  `apps/grand_perspective/gp_model.ae:49` (`CRUMBS() -> int { return 8 }`),
  `gp_state.ae:37-40` ("widgets can't be created post-build" — the STALE
  belief, plus `crumb0: int` pool fields), relabel/hide loop at
  `gp_nav.ae:101-115` (`update_crumbs`), context-menu wiring loop at
  `grand_perspective.ae:338-345`. The pool also means each crumb carries
  ONE pre-wired context_menu_item whose closure reads `st.current.path`
  at fire time — replacing the pool must keep "Copy path" working.
- **Track-by prior art (LATER, not v1):** `vg/grammar/bind.ae:116`
  (`region_set_trackby`, closure returning a string key per item).
  Don't import its machinery; it's the naming/shape precedent only.
- **List state:** `ui_state` is doubles-only (roadmap item 8's problem —
  NOT yours). `each` v1 takes an explicit `std.list` of `ptr` items via
  an update call; do not build typed reactive list-state here.
- **Driver:** `/widgets` already reflects runtime-added widgets (proven
  in the overlay work); `parent` field + `/widget/{id}/children` route
  exist. Removal visibility in `/widgets` is what the spec must pin.

## Design decisions already made (don't relitigate)

- **v1 reconcile = clear + rebuild.** On update: `clear_children`-style
  removal of the each-group's widgets, then re-run the item builder per
  item. Correctness first; crumbs/rows don't hold focus or edit state.
  Keyed reuse (track-by) is a LATER item — leave a comment, not code.
- **`each` owns a plain child container.** The verb creates its own
  vstack/hstack inside the parent (orientation param) and rebuilds
  INSIDE that — so it never touches siblings outside its group, and
  clear-and-rebuild can't eat the rest of the window. This also
  sidesteps insert-at entirely for v1 (append into an empty box).
- **Update is an explicit call** (`each_update(e, items)`), imperative
  like everything else ui-side today. When item 8 lands typed/list
  state, `each` gets a binding overload; not now.
- **Item builder receives (item: ptr, i: int)** and builds into an
  injected parent handle using the existing handle-as-first-arg pattern.
- **No vg-side work.** vg already has bind/Repeater-ish machinery; this
  brief is the ui (widget) side only.

## Deliverables

### D1 — the `each` verb + reconciler (ui/module.ae, pure Aether)
- `each(_ctx: ptr, orientation: string, spacing: int, render: fn) -> ptr`
  — creates the group container (vstack for "v", hstack for "h") in the
  enclosing block, stores the boxed render closure + container handle in
  a small heap struct, returns the each-handle (ptr).
- `each_update(e: ptr, items: ptr)` — clears the group container's
  children and re-runs `render(item, i)` for each list element, with the
  group container injected so the render body's verbs attach to it.
  (Invoke the stored closure via the fn-typed-param bridge — the
  `events.ae` invoker pattern, `vg/grammar/events.ae:259`.)
- `each_count(e: ptr) -> int` — last rendered count (for tests/apps).
- Exports + doc comment showing the canonical usage:
  ```
  crumbs = each("h", 4) callback |it: ptr, i: int| {
      e = it as *FileEntry
      _ = btn(each_parent(crumbs), e.name) callback { … }
  }
  ...
  each_update(crumbs, stack_list)
  ```
  NOTE the render body needs the group handle — provide
  `each_parent(e) -> int` OR pass the parent handle as a third callback
  arg `|item, i, parent|`; pick whichever the closure/param plumbing
  makes cleaner (the 3-arg form avoids the chicken-and-egg of using
  `crumbs` inside its own defining block — RECOMMENDED).
- If GTK_IS_BOX-only `clear_children` proves insufficient for the group
  container, extend the C impl minimally (it's already box-only-safe:
  the group IS a box by construction).

### D2 — example + spec (driver-first)
- `examples/each_demo/` (aeb node like overlay_demo): a textfield-free
  demo with "Add item" / "Remove last" / "Reset" buttons mutating a
  local `std.list`, calling `each_update`; each item renders a
  label + a per-item button proving per-item closures fire correctly
  (e.g. clicking item i writes "clicked <name>" to a status line).
- `tests/each_demo/spec_each_demo.ae` (Aeocha): assert `/widgets` grows
  after Add, shrinks after Remove (the count of items in the group),
  per-item click round-trips to the status text, Reset → empty. Wire as
  a ci.sh phase (5e, following 5b/5c/5d precedent).
- uidriver helper if needed (e.g. counting widgets whose parent == the
  group container) — extend `tests/lib/uidriver.ae` like
  `widget_int_field_by_id` was.

### D3 — the proving consumer: gp breadcrumbs
Replace the CRUMBS()=8 pool in grand_perspective with `each`:
- `gp_state.ae`: drop the crumb pool fields (`crumb0`…) + the stale
  comment; hold the each-handle instead.
- `gp_nav.ae` `update_crumbs`: becomes `each_update(crumbs, stack)` with
  the render building one button per stack entry (label = clip_name,
  ellipsis logic for depth > visible as today — decide whether to keep
  the 8-visible cap as a RENDER decision (slice the list) rather than a
  pool size; keeping the cap keeps layouts identical and specs stable —
  RECOMMENDED).
- The per-crumb "Copy path" context_menu_item moves INTO the render
  closure (attached to each new button as it's built).
- Gate: all 5 gp Aeocha specs green UNCHANGED (they assert crumb
  behavior via click/drill flows — if a spec asserts a pool artifact
  that legitimately changed, fix the assertion and say so in the commit;
  do not weaken behavioral assertions).

### Stretch (only if D1–D3 green with time left; separate commits)
- Keyed reuse (track-by) — reuse existing child widgets when the item
  key at an index is unchanged. Follow `region_set_trackby`'s shape.
- `insert_child_at` backend + `each` splice path.
- win32/macOS verification is NOT in scope beyond "stubs/impls compile"
  (next time on winbaz / the Mac mini — note remove_child there is
  real code but untested).

## Execution phases — each ends with a commit; gates are hard

**Phase A — characterize.** `rm -rf ~/.aether/cache`; full `./ci.sh`
baseline (must be green; STOP if not). Probe in a scratch app (not
committed): (1) `clear_children` on a live GTK4 box actually removes
rendered children + `/widgets` reflects it; (2) re-adding after clear
works repeatedly (10 cycles, no crash/leak explosion); (3) a boxed
closure created inside a *callback* (not the build block) fires
correctly when its button is clicked later (the ae-0.255 drain-gate
territory — expected fine, verify anyway).

**Phase B — D1 + D2.** The verb, the demo, the spec, ci.sh Phase 5e.
Gate: new spec green + full ci.sh green. Commit.

**Phase C — D3.** The gp crumb replacement. Gate: 5 gp specs + full
ci.sh green; screenshot gp before/after at default size and after a
3-deep drill — crumbs must look the same (eyeball, attach findings to
the commit message). Commit.

**Phase D — closeout.** Mark roadmap item 3 DONE (house style: item 1/2
DONE blocks), delete this brief in the same commit (precedent 2e72530).

## Acceptance checklist

- [ ] `ui.each` + `each_update` + `each_count` exported, doc-commented.
- [ ] each_demo example + Aeocha spec in ci.sh (Phase 5e); add/remove/
      reset/per-item-click all asserted via the driver.
- [ ] gp: `CRUMBS()` pool GONE (`grep -rn "crumb0\|CRUMBS()" apps/` →
      only historical comments at most); crumbs fully dynamic; "Copy
      path" context menu still works (fileops spec covers it).
- [ ] `grep -rn "can't be created post-build" apps/` → no hits (the
      stale belief comment dies with the pool).
- [ ] Full `./ci.sh` green (all phases, incl. the 5 gp specs).
- [ ] roadmap.md item 3 marked DONE; briefs/each.md deleted.

## Environmental traps (every one has cost a real debugging session)

- **Compiler cache:** `rm -rf ~/.aether/cache` after ANY edit to an
  imported module (ui/module.ae edits especially). Stale caches produce
  impossible E0301s and silently run old code.
- **ui/module.ae imports go AFTER the exports block** (house style; it
  now has `import std.string` — add others there).
- **Driver apps:** end via `curl -X POST :9222/shutdown`, never by
  killing xvfb-run. One app at a time (`curl -sf :9222/widgets || echo
  free`). Port always 9222; `AETHER_UI_TEST_PORT` must be SET to arm.
- **Xvfb recipe:** `GDK_BACKEND=x11 WAYLAND_DISPLAY= GSK_RENDERER=cairo
  xvfb-run -a -s "-screen 0 3200x2000x24"`.
- **GTK layout frames:** freshly added/removed widgets need a frame
  before geometry/pick queries see them — specs use
  `wait_body_contains`, not immediate asserts (overlay-layer lesson).
- **Language:** `state`/`spawn`/`match` reserved; no top-level mutable
  globals; block-form callbacks need the `callback` postfix keyword;
  `${}` interpolation can't contain string literals; multiple
  `opt_s()`-style calls in ONE println interpolation corrupt — use temp
  vars. Closures into C: `box_closure`, C side retains.
- **Invoking a stored closure from Aether:** the fn-typed-param bridge
  (store as ptr, call via a helper taking `cb: fn`) — see
  `vg/grammar/events.ae:259-267`.
- **gp specs are behavioral** — they drill/click/read status. Run them
  individually while iterating (`UI_SPEC=grand_perspective/spec_map_nav
  tests/run_spec.sh`) before the full ci.sh.

## Out of scope — do not do these even if tempting

- No typed/reactive list state (item 8's job); `each_update` is
  explicit.
- No keyed reuse/track-by in v1 (stretch only).
- No vg-side repeater work.
- No closure-release/registry-compaction protocol (document the small
  per-removed-button leak instead).
- No table/list widget (item 4 — `each` merely unlocks it).
- No win32/macOS behavioral work (compile-only there this pass).
- No aeocha/aether/aeb (sibling repo) changes. Suspected compiler bug:
  minimal probe in scratchpad, document, STOP and report.

## Escalation triggers — stop and report instead of pushing through

1. Phase-A probe shows repeated clear+rebuild crashes or visibly leaks
   (GTK criticals spray, memory climbs fast) → the registry/closure
   story needs design work; report with the probe.
2. Invoking the stored render closure per-item from `each_update`
   hits closure/codegen issues (wrong item ptr, env corruption) →
   minimal repro, document, STOP (compiler territory — the
   builder-ctx/closure history says report, don't work around).
3. gp crumb replacement breaks a gp spec in a way that isn't a
   legitimate behavioral improvement → report; don't weaken specs.
