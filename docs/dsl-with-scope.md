# DSL with Scope

> "DSL with scope" — Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto, when asked what to call the

Aether UI (and AeVG, its vector-graphics layer) is built as a **DSL with
Scope**: nested blocks that read declaratively but are *executed code*, with
an **implicit receiver** so children attach to their enclosing scope without
explicit parent-child plumbing.

## The lineage

This pattern runs through:

- **Smalltalk** — block-based APIs (`do:[…]`), the original implicit-receiver
  cascades.
- **Ruby** — Shoes (`Shoes.app do … end`), Sinatra, RSpec; blocks with
  `instance_eval`.
- **Groovy** — SwingBuilder, MarkupBuilder; closures with a delegate.
- **Kotlin** — Jetpack Compose, TornadoFX.
- **Swift** — SwiftUI.

Paul Hammant's
[*That Ruby and Groovy Language Feature*](https://paulhammant.com/2024/02/14/that-ruby-and-groovy-language-feature.html)
surveys the same calculator written across all of these and plots them on a
terse-vs-elegant axis. The defining trait, as that piece draws out (quoting
Gemini on the distinction): a markup language like HTML is **parsed into a
structure** (the DOM) for *secondary* actioning; a DSL-with-Scope is
**interpreted or compiled like any 3GL** — the block *runs*, creating elements
imperatively as it goes. It is pseudo-declarative: it reads like a description
of structure, but every line is real code that can loop, branch, and capture
state.

## How Aether does it

Aether's mechanism is documented in the language repo's
[`docs/closures-and-builder-dsl.md`](https://github.com/aether-lang-org/aether/blob/main/docs/closures-and-builder-dsl.md).
Three pieces matter here:

1. **Trailing blocks** — any call may be followed by `{ … }`, run inline as
   DSL structure (`window("App", 400, 200) { … }`).
2. **The `_ctx` implicit receiver** — a function whose first parameter is
   `_ctx: ptr` has that parameter *hidden from callers* and *auto-injected*
   from the builder-context stack inside a trailing block. This is how
   `text("hi")` inside a `vstack { … }` attaches to the vstack without anyone
   passing the parent. (Matz's "implicit receiver"; Groovy's delegate;
   Ruby's `self` in an `instance_eval` block.)
3. **`builder … with <factory>` — "configure then execute"** — a `builder`
   function flips the order: the trailing block runs *first* (filling a
   config object the `with` factory created and pushed as `_ctx`), then the
   function *body* runs. This is the after-block epilogue: the block builds
   eagerly and in place, and the function gets to act *after* it closes.
4. **UFCS — `x.f(args)` → `f(x, args)`** — the orthogonal *value-chain* axis
   (Aether #928, cross-module #934). When a free function's first parameter
   matches `typeof(x)`, it's callable in method position. The explicit-handle
   modifiers (`style_font_size`, `width`, `height`, …) each return their
   handle, so they compose left-to-right — see
   [Chaining explicit-handle modifiers](#chaining-explicit-handle-modifiers-ufcs)
   below.

## Surfaces are DSL-with-Scope all the way down

The Aether UI entry point is a **surface** scope — `window`, `render_to`, or
`record` (see the [README](../README.md#surfaces-window--render_to--record)).
Each is a `builder … with` function:

- The `with` factory creates the surface's content container and pushes it as
  `_ctx`, so the block's widgets/shapes attach to the surface.
- The block runs first — eagerly, in order — populating the surface.
- The body runs *after*: `window` runs the event loop; the bounded surfaces
  (`render_to`, `record`) finalize and return.

```aether
window("Calculator", 280, 260) {     // surface scope (lived: owns the loop)
    root_vstack(4) {                  // layout scope
        text_bound(display, " ", "")
        hstack(4) {                   // nested scope
            btn("7") callback { call(digit, 7) }
            button("+") {             // leaf + its config block
                bg_color(0.95, 0.85, 0.5, 1.0)
                onclick() callback { call(apply_op, plus) }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Every `{ }` is a scope; every verb inside acts on the ambient receiver of its
enclosing scope. The `window` body — the loop — runs once the whole tree is
built, because `window` is a `builder`.

### Why a surface, not `app_run`?

The earlier `app_run(title, w, h, root)` bundled three jobs — create the
window, mount the tree, run the loop — and forced that *lived* shape onto every
program. But a drawing rendered to a PNG, printed to paper, or captured for a
test needs no event loop and no window: it establishes a surface, the block
runs into it, and control returns at `}`. Only a live window has a life of its
own that ends on an external event (the close button), so only `window` runs a
loop. Splitting the one verb into three surface kinds makes the lifecycle
honest — and means "applications need not have a fat UI": a program can open a
`record` or `render_to` surface, draw, and exit, never touching a window loop.

## Chaining explicit-handle modifiers (UFCS)

The `_ctx` axis above styles the *ambient* widget inside a block
(`button("OK") { corner_radius(8); tooltip("…") }`). The complementary case
is styling a widget you captured *by name* — and that's where UFCS reads best.
Every explicit-handle modifier (`style_*`, `width`, `height`, `fill_*`,
`alignment`, `distribution`, `edge_insets`, `margin_of`, the `set_*` state
mutators, the `on_*` handlers, and the `tray_set_*` setters) returns its
handle, so `x.f(a)` (which desugars to `f(x, a)`) chains:

```aether
title = text("Aether UI Styled Demo")
title.style_font_size(20).style_font_bold().style_text_color(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)

submit.style_bg_color(0.2, 0.6, 0.3, 1.0)
      .style_corner_radius(8)
      .style_tooltip("Click to submit the form")
```

Both forms still work — UFCS is a *last-resort* fallback (it only fires when a
dotted call would otherwise be undefined), so the flat
`style_font_size(title, 20)` is unchanged. The chain is purely sugar: each
`x.f(a)` lowers to the same `f(x, a)` call, and the handle threaded through is
a register-width int the C backend elides.

block) in the AeVG README.
